# Cooperative Multi-Task Semantic Communication: Adaptability to PHY Techniques

This repository contains the implementation and supporting materials for the master project titled **“Cooperative Multi-Task Semantic Communication: Adaptability to PHY Techniques.”** The project explores how semantic (meaning-based) communication can be combined with advanced physical-layer (PHY) techniques—specifically Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)—to enable efficient multi-task processing over wireless channels.

## Overview

Traditional communication systems focus on transmitting raw bits reliably from a sender to a receiver. As new applications demand more intelligent data processing (e.g., autonomous driving or IoT networks), **semantic communication** emerges as a paradigm that emphasizes **task-relevant** transmission rather than raw data fidelity. 

This project integrates a **multi-task semantic communication** framework—where multiple tasks share a single transmitted signal—together with **NOMA** at the physical layer. By splitting the semantic encoder into a **Common Unit (CU)** (for shared features) and **Specific Units (SUs)** (for task-specific processing), it is possible to:

1. **Reduce redundancy** by extracting shared features once.
2. **Allow multiple tasks** to exploit these features, each with its own specialized encoder/decoder component.
3. **Improve resource usage** at the PHY layer with NOMA, which superimposes multiple user signals.

## Key Features

- **Split Encoder Design**  
  A dual-stage encoder that divides input processing into:
  - A Common Unit (CU) to capture information relevant to *all* tasks.
  - Specific Units (SUs) to handle *task-specific* encoding.

- **Multi-Task Processing**  
  Enables multiple semantic tasks (e.g., binary and categorical classification) to be served by a single transmitted signal.

- **NOMA Integration**  
  Demonstrates how power-domain NOMA can be used in the uplink to allow simultaneous transmission from multiple tasks/devices. Includes:
  - Superposition coding of multi-task signals.
  - DNN-based or SIC-based decoding at the base station.

- **Deep Neural Network (DNN) Decoding**  
  Investigates *DNN-based NOMA decoders* for improved performance, particularly at lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) or with high-interference scenarios.

- **Multiple Case Studies**  
  Compares architectures:
  - With and without the Common Unit (CU).
  - Non-NOMA vs. NOMA.
  - DNN-based NOMA vs. SIC-based NOMA.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.x** (recommend 3.8+)
2. **Deep Learning Framework** (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow)
3. **Numpy, Matplotlib, etc.** as needed
4. [Optional] **GPU support** for larger experiments.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/semantic-comm-noma.git
   cd semantic-comm-noma
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional) Configure a **virtual environment** for isolation:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or "venv\Scripts\activate" on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Methodology

1. **Probabilistic Semantic Source**  
   Each data sample (e.g., an MNIST image) is associated with multiple tasks (e.g., digit classification, presence detection).  
2. **Split Encoder**  
   - **Common Unit (CU):** Captures shared semantic features from the observation.  
   - **Specific Unit (SU):** Refines shared features into task-specific representations.  
3. **NOMA Superposition**  
   Encoded task signals are superimposed in the power domain and transmitted simultaneously.  
4. **DNN-Based NOMA Decoder**  
   A unified or multi-output neural network reconstructs semantic variables for all tasks from the received superimposed signal.  
5. **Optimization**  
   The system maximizes task-relevant mutual information via end-to-end training with reconstruction or classification losses for multiple tasks.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data**  
   - Download or place MNIST data in `data/mnist/` (or specify the path in config).
   - Run any provided script to prepare or normalize the data.

2. **Train the Model**  
   ```bash
   python src/train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
   ```
   - Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, batch size) or specify in a YAML/JSON file.

3. **Evaluate / Test**  
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py --model_path results/checkpoints/best_model.pth
   ```
   - Plots performance metrics (e.g., classification accuracy, task error rate) vs. SNR.

4. **Generate Figures and Logs**  
   - Results are saved to `results/plots/` and `results/logs/`.
   - Update or customize the plotting scripts for your analysis.

## Results and Analysis

Key findings from the project include:

- **Split Encoder Advantages**  
  The presence of a Common Unit (CU) consistently reduces task error rates, especially for complex tasks where shared features yield more benefits.
- **NOMA vs. Non-NOMA**  
  - **NOMA** (with a DNN-based decoder) offers improved multi-task performance and better resource utilization, particularly as SNR increases.  
  - **Non-NOMA** can be simpler but performs suboptimally in high-user or multi-task scenarios.
- **DNN NOMA vs. SIC NOMA**  
  The DNN-based approach mitigates error propagation and outperforms traditional SIC-based decoding, especially under low SNR or complex tasks.

Representative plots (Task Error Rate vs. SNR) demonstrate how the combination of CU + NOMA + DNN decoding can outperform baseline methods.

## Future Work

1. **Extending to More Tasks**  
   Scale to additional tasks and more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR, speech data).
2. **Resource-Constrained Scenarios**  
   Investigate compression and quantization strategies for edge devices.
3. **Advanced Channel Models**  
   Evaluate system performance under fading channels, multi-antenna setups, or real-world conditions.
4. **Unified Decoder vs. Multiple Decoders**  
   Expand design trade-offs when employing a single unified decoder for all tasks or separate decoders per task.
